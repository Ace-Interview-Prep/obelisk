# Obelisk Routing

## Motivation

The `obelisk-route` package is designed to help with managing the paths and parameters for routing
in your application.

Most importantly it has been designed and built to provide the following guarantees.

* **Every route value can be encoded to a URL**

Every route that you declare in your types will produce a valid URL, i.e. encoding cannot fail.

* **When you decode something you've encoded, you'll always get the same value back**

```haskell
decode . encode = pure
```

Route declared using `obelisk-route` are bidirectional, meaning that any route that can be encode
to types and matched on can also be encoded as a url *without losing information*.

* **Common modifications made to routes, whereever possible, will be caught by the compiler.**

When you make common modifications to routes, such as adding or removing a route, you get
"incomplete case" and similar warnings everywhere you need to update your application. The type
system also makes it *much* easier to catch those easy to forget things, such as updating nav-bars,
or the breadcrumb widget that needs a human-readable description.

* **Behaviour of routes is identical for Backend and Frontend**

This package doesn't have a distinction between backend or frontend routes, these are only different
types so their behaviour is identical. This guarantees that rendering completed during backend
hydration will be indistinguishable from rendering on the frontend.

It may seem odd that `obelisk-route` does not provide a way to specify the HTTP Method for a given
route. This is due to the requirement that this package may be used when rendering a page on the
backend **or** the frontend. A POST request makes no sense for the frontend of an application so we
do not support creating this type of route. As it would be difficult to impossible to enforce if
the routing system worked differently on the backend vs the frontend.

## Thinking in routes

The way to approach building routes with `obelisk-route` is to focus on your Route data structure.

First, make sure it matches your application's structure: with one Route value for each logical
page the user might want to visit.  Only once that is clear, move on to thinking about how those
logical pages ought to appear in the user's address bar.  For instance, you might want each user's
profile to show up at `/user/$userid`.

Finally, consider how you want to handle URLs with slight differences, like an extra trailing slash
or different capitalization, or URLs whose rendering format has changed.  By doing things in this
order, you design your routes around your application, rather than designing your application around
your routes.

We define this structure in `obelisk-route` using `Encoder`s. These are pure functions that
_compose_ together to build the concrete definition of your routing structure. By composing and
building routes from pieces that are so small that they are "obviously correct", you can be
confident that the composition of those individual pieces is also correct.

Avoid approaching this package as a collection of 'encoders' and 'decoders' for turning strings into
things and things into strings. This will, more often than not, lead to you fighting the API and
making things needlessly difficult.

As we build up some examples in this guide, we will demonstrate how to think about and explain your
abstract routes as concrete definitions using `Encoder`s as pure functions. You will see that
`obelisk-route` already has most of the tools you need to construct that concrete definition. We'll
also cover what to do when it doesn't, and what you need to know to ensure that you build correct
and composable pieces.

## Simple route with one parameter

For our first route, we want to have a route for every user that is parameterised on their user
ID. Expressed as an abstractly it might look something like this:

```haskell
data Route = Route_User Int
```

We'll briefly discuss some of the types that are involved and then go through the process of adding
the concrete definition of this route to our application.

## Building blocks

There are a few pieces required to build routes in Obelisk and there is plenty to dig into if you
are curious. For the time being we can survive with a surface level understanding.

#### `Encoder`

This is the primary building block for any route definition. It looks a lot worse than it is:

```haskell
-- The 'check' and 'parse' type variables will be covered later
data Encoder check parse a b
```

You can think of an `Encoder check parse a b` as a thing of type `a -> b`. Indeed, `Encoder`s may be
composed using `(.)` from `Control.Category`, as `Encoder` is an instance of `Category`.

#### Aside: a more general composition

When composing `Encoder`s the operator we need is the more general version from the
`Control.Category` module. This is because the one from `Prelude` is specialised to the function
arrow type `(->)`, whereas the one in `Control.Category` uses the `Category` typeclass:

```haskell
-- (.) from Prelude
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c

-- (.) from Control.Category
(.) :: Category cat => cat b c -> cat a b -> cat a c
```

The `Encoder` type is an instance of `Category` so we need to use the more general function. Ensure
that `(.)` is imported correctly at the top of `Common.Route`:

 ```haskell
import Prelude hiding ((.))
import Control.Category
```

If you use the `(.)` from `Prelude` then you will end up with type errors similar to the following:

```shell
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘b0 -> c0’
                  with actual type ‘Encoder check0 parse0 [Text] PageName’
    • In the first argument of ‘(.)’, namely ‘pathOnlyEncoder’
```

Where you can see that it expected something of type `b0 -> c0` whereas we're wanting to compose `Encoder`s.

----

An `Encoder` may describe an individual segment such as:

```haskell
Encoder check parse Text PageName
```

Or a collection of routes:

```haskell
Encoder check parse (R MyBlogRoutes) PageName
```

#### `pathComponentEncoder` & `SegmentResult`

These are used in tandem to with a `case` expression of the constructors of the route type, such as
`FrontendRoute`, and provide the necessary `Encoder`s for each route definition.

The `SegmentResult` type that acts as part of this functions interface has a list-like structure
with a recursive component and a terminating case.

The recursive case is the `PathSegment Text (Encoder check parse a PageName)` constructor that
encodes a literal segment in the path, followed by an `Encoder`.

The terminating case is the `PathEnd (Encoder check parse a (Map Text (Maybe Text)))` constructor.
It is used to indicate that there is only this single segment in that route, or to terminate a
longer parent route.

#### `BackendRoute` & `FrontendRoute`

An Obelisk application begins with two distinct sets of routes for backend and frontend. These
are defined as GADTs called `BackendRoute` and `FrontendRoute`, respectively.

For more info on GADTs check out the following links:
* [Haskell Wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Generalised_algebraic_datatype)
* [What I Wish I Knew When Learning Haskell - GADTs](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/#gadts)
* [Haskellforall](http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/gadts.html)

In a freshly generated Obelisk application these live in the `Common.Route` module.

`BackendRoute` is for serving static things or deferring to other backend endpoints. Such as:
- "static/files/img/:imgName:"
- "api/..." where the "..." portion is managed by a REST endpoint package of your choice.

These backend routes can run their own code or hand off to a different request handling package,
such as `servant`, for a finer grained set of REST endpoints.

`FrontendRoute` is for managing the frontend routing of your application. Such as:
- "blog/:userId:/:postId:"
- "dashboard?optionA=true".

Building routes for either one is the same process. The only distinction is that the names
indicate who is _serving_ the routes. Keeping the types separate enforces the distinction
at compile time and helps to prevent errors.

#### Obelisk live development environment

For best results, work through this tutorial using a freshly created Obelisk application. Refer to the Obelisk documentation for [Developing an Obelisk project](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk#developing-an-obelisk-project).

### Defining our route as a type

To create the route itself, we will add a constructor to the `FrontendRoute` GADT in `Common.Route`.

The purpose of this constructor is to give a name and a value to a particular route. It provides a
constructor to match on when we're deciding what code to run. It will also be used to help build
type-safe links within our application, as well as declare what types are expected from the route.

Recall that our abstract route definition was a route for every user, parameterised over their user
ID. Now we begin to make this into a concrete definition.

Add the following constructor to `FrontendRoute` in `Common.Route`:

```haskell
  FrontendRoute_User :: FrontendRoute Int
```

This constructor indicates that we have a `FrontendRoute` that when successfully loaded, will
provide the current user ID `Int` that was input on that route.

> The naming of the route 'FrontendRoute_User' is an Obelisk convention of including the type
> name in individual constructor names. This helps disambiguate the code at the 'cost' of a few
> extra keystrokes. As an example:
>
> ```haskell
> data Foo
>   = Foo_ConstructorA
>   | Foo_ConstructorB
> ```

### Building our route from segments

If you're following along with `ob run` then after you added the new constructor and saved the
file. New incompleteness warnings will have appeared in the output of `ob run`. This is GHC and the
type system helping us out by pointing out the next steps for us now that we've extended our
`FrontendRoutes` type.

The next step is to fill in the definition of our new route. The primary function that contains
these definitions is the `fullRouteEncoder` function, located in `Common.Route`.

Add our new constructor as another pattern in the `case` expression for the frontend routes. For now
add a type-hole on the right hand side of our new `case` expression and save the file. The `ob run`
output should update and tell you the type of the expression that it is expecting:

```haskell
fullRouteEncoder
  :: Encoder (Either Text) Identity (R (FullRoute BackendRoute FrontendRoute)) PageName
fullRouteEncoder = mkFullRouteEncoder
  (FullRoute_Backend BackendRoute_Missing :/ ())
  (\case
      BackendRoute_Missing -> PathSegment "missing" $ unitEncoder mempty)
  (\case
      FrontendRoute_Main -> PathEnd $ unitEncoder mempty
      -- Add the new constructor here
      FrontendRoute_User -> _todo
  )
```

The output will be:

```shell
    • Found hole:
        _todo :: SegmentResult (Either Text) (Either Text) Int
      Or perhaps ‘_todo’ is mis-spelled, or not in scope
```

This is telling us that we have to construct a `SegmentResult` to be paired with our
`FrontendRoute_User` constructor to form part of the complete `Encoder` for `FrontendRoutes`.

Looking back at the `SegmentResult` type, it has two constructors. The one that we need is the
`PathSegment` constructor:

```haskell
  | PathSegment Text (Encoder check parse a PageName)
```

This is because our route definition has multiple parts, one of which is static. Use the literal
value "user" as the first argument to the constructor, leaving a typed hole as the second
argument. The `case` expression should now look like this:

```haskell
  FrontendRoute_User -> PathSegment "user" _todo
```

The output from `ob run` will update and look something like this:

```shell
    • Found hole:
        _todo :: Encoder (Either Text) (Either Text) Int PageName
      Or perhaps ‘_todo’ is mis-spelled, or not in scope
```

Remembering that we can squint a bit and view an `Encoder` as a function from `a -> b`, this makes
the next typed hold that we have to fill, have a shape similar to `Int -> PageName`. Our next task
will be to build that `Encoder` and fill that hole.

#### Wait a minute, shouldn't I be matching on the route on the left?

In many routing systems you match directly on the route input and break it down as required. This
process can be fragile and has limitations. Additionally you are left on your own when comes to
_creating_ links in your application. Because there is no way to relate the structure of a route to
anything, you have to manually build up routes again. If any of those routes change it can be a
tedious and error-prone process to find and fix all the constructed links.

Obelisk routes are bidirectional, which means the `Encoder` that you create works as both a 'pattern
match' for incoming routes. As well as using the GADT constructors as a type safe mechanism for
_creating_ links in your application. It's a compile error to try to use route constructors that
don't exist, and if you change the type of a route the application will not build until you fix that
change every where it appears.

----

### Completing our first encoder

Within the `Obelisk.Route` module are many pre-built `Encoders`, for our purposes we need to find
one that can be used to satisfy the `Int -> PageName` shaped hole. The `readShowEncoder` matches our
requirements:

```haskell
readShowEncoder
  :: ( MonadError Text parse
     , Read a
     , Show a
     , Applicative check
     )
  => Encoder check parse a PageName
```

This `Encoder` is capable of dealing with any type that has instances of `Read` and `Show`. However
it is only a legal `Encoder` is these instances are inverses of one another. That is if they satisfy
this test:

```haskell
forall t. read (show t) === t
```

Recall that our typed hole tells us we need to construct a value of the following type:

```haskell
_todo :: Encoder (Either Text) (Either Text) Int PageName
```

#### Aside `PageName`

This type is a combination of the URL and a query string and is the target type of a _complete_
route `Encoder`. Individual `Encoder`s will work with different types, but often the final type of a
chain of `Encoder`s will be a `PageName`. However it is unlikely you will ever need to construct
this type yourself as `obelisk-route` will do that for you.

----

We can safely simplify these the type of `readShowEncoder` a bit for the sake of understanding:

```haskell
readShowEncoder :: (Read a, Show a) => a -> PageName
```

Conveniently `Int` has an instance of both `Read` and `Show`, satisfying both constraints of the
`readShowEncoder` becoming:

```haskell
readShowEncoder :: Int -> PageName
```

Which is exactly what we wanted! So we're able to replace our typed hole `_todo` with
`readShowEncoder` and we've created our first complete route `Encoder`. Yay. This `Encoder` does the
simplest useful thing while being obviously correct.

Our `case` expression should now look like this:

```haskell
  FrontendRoute_User -> PathSegment "user" readShowEncoder
```

Update our `case` expression and replace the typed hole with this `Encoder` and save the file. The
`ob run` will update and tell us the next step.

It should be a rare event that you will need to write your own `Encoder` function like
`unwrappedEncoder` directly. The provided `Encoder`s in `Obelisk.Route` are designed to be composed
and combined to build more complicated encoders and should be sufficient for most requirements. If
you find this is not the case and there is a pattern that keeps appearing and is not accounted for,
then that is probably a bug and we'd like to know about it!

As this continues we will demonstrate more complicated routes and how to define them. We will
discover more of the functionality provided within `obelisk-route`. But for now we need to integrate
our routes into the application and see how to make decisions and access the values from the route.

## Using routes

Now we can update the Frontend of our application to do something with this routing information.

We're going to make the rest of these changes in the main `Frontend.hs` in the `frontend`
package. If you're following along with a freshly minted Obelisk application then it should look
something like this:

```haskell
frontend :: Frontend (R FrontendRoute)
frontend = Frontend
  { _frontend_head = do
      el "title" $ text "Obelisk Minimal Example"
      elAttr "link" ("href" =: static @"main.css" <> "type" =: "text/css" <> "rel" =: "stylesheet") blank
  , _frontend_body = do
      el "h1" $ text "Welcome to Obelisk!"
      el "p" $ text $ T.pack commonStuff

      -- `prerender` and `prerender_` let you choose a widget to run on the server
      -- during prerendering and a different widget to run on the client with
      -- JavaScript. The following will generate a `blank` widget on the server and
      -- print "Hello, World!" on the client.
      prerender_ blank $ liftJSM $ void $ eval ("console.log('Hello, World!')" :: T.Text)

      elAttr "img" ("src" =: static @"obelisk.jpg") blank
      el "div" $ do
        exampleConfig <- getConfig "common/example"
        case exampleConfig of
          Nothing -> text "No config file found in config/common/example"
          Just s -> text $ T.decodeUtf8 s
      return ()
  }
```

We're going to modify the function at `_frontend_body` to show different content for the main or
user page, and then link between them.

Notice that part of the type of `frontend` is `R FrontendRoute`. That is the same `FrontendRoute`
type that we added our user route to. This tells us which routes are available for us to match on
in this function. We can't accidentally match on a route that is not part of that type, it would
be a compile error.

#### Aside: `R`

The `R` type is a type alias that lets us talk about a set of routes, such as
`FrontendRoute`, as a whole. Recall that a route GADT is declared with a single type variable, and
that type variable is fixed for each individual route in that GADT. It would not be possible to use
the individual routes if we were forced to leave the type variable exposed. The function would never
type-check. By using the type alias that wraps a [`DSum` (dependent sum)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dependent-sum-0.7.1.0/docs/Data-Dependent-Sum.html#t:DSum) we can specify the
available routes in a type signature.

----

At the top of our `_frontend_body` function, before the `do`, we're going to insert the
`subRoute_` function and turn this entire function into a `case` expression that shows different
content based on the current route. The existing content will be moved into the branch for
`FrontendRoute_Main` and it will look a bit like this:

```haskell
  , _frontend_body = subRoute_ $ \r -> case r of
    FrontendRoute_Main -> do
      el "h1" $ text "Welcome to Obelisk!"
      {- The initial body content goes here -}
```

Alternatively you can turn on the `{-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase #-}` language extension and avoid
needing to bind the `r` variable:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase #-} -- put this at the top of the file
...
  , _frontend_body = subRoute_ $ \case
    FrontendRoute_Main -> do
      el "h1" $ text "Welcome to Obelisk!"
      {- The initial body content goes here -}
```

As another branch in `case` expression, add our `FrontendRoute_User` constructor:

```haskell
  , _frontend_body = subRoute_ $ \case
    FrontendRoute_User -> _todo
    FrontendRoute_Main -> do
```

Now to add some content.

Using the `askRoute` function from the `Obelisk.Route.Frontend` module we can access a `Dynamic` of
the `Int` that represents the user ID. This is because the type that we had in our `FrontendRoute`
GADT type is stored in a `ReaderT` that changes based on which route we're currently matching on.

Were we to use `askRoute` in the `Frontend_Main` branch of our `case` expression, the resulting
`Dynamic` would contain a value of unit `()` because that is the type of the `Frontend_Main`
route.

Update the `FrontendRoute_User` branch of our `case` expression to the following:

```haskell
  , _frontend_body = subRoute_ $ \case
    FrontendRoute_User -> do
      text "We're on the user page! But which user?"
      dUserId <- askRoute
      dyn_ $ ffor dUserId $ \uidVal ->
        text $ "This user : " <> T.pack (show uidVal)

    FrontendRoute_Main -> do
      ...
```

### Building links

We have separate content based on the route, but we don't have any links yet!

With the `routeLink` function, also from the `Obelisk.Route.Frontend` module, we can create type
safe links to different parts of our application. We will first link to the user page from the main
page. Somewhere in the body of the `FrontendRoute_Main` content, add the following:

```haskell
routeLink (FrontendRoute_User :/ 42) $
  text "Visit the page of User # 42"
```

We define the link we want by using the constructor from our `FrontendRoute` type and using the
function `(:/)` from `Obelisk.Route`, and we provide the required input of an `Int` to satisfy the
type of `FrontendRoute_User`. Then we create a child widget with some content that when clicked will
take us to the user page.

Similarily, we can create a link on the user page to take us to the main page:

```haskell
routeLink (FrontendRoute_Main :/ ()) $
  text "To the main page!"
```

You should now have an Obelisk application with some rudimentary routing and enough of a start to
begin building your application with type safe routes! Hooray!!
